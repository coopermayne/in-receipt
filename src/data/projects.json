Each room was positioned to capture specific moments of the day—the morning light in the primary suite, the sunset in the living room, the moonrise from the study.\n\nBelow the main level, a series of terraced gardens cascade toward the cliff edge, planted with drought-tolerant natives that require no irrigation. A serpentine path winds down to a protected cove, providing private beach access. The pool, cantilevered beyond the cliff face, creates the illusion of swimming directly into the horizon.",

Rather than the heavy timber lodges typical of the region, the design employs a restrained palette of concrete, glass, and weathering steel that ages gracefully alongside the surrounding granite peaks.\n\nThe house is organized as a series of pavilions connected by glass corridors, each structure oriented to frame a specific view: the lake to the east, the ski slopes to the north, the forest to the west. In winter, these corridors become light-filled passages that bring the snow-covered landscape inside. In summer, they open completely, transforming the home into a collection of covered outdoor rooms.\n\nRadiant floors powered by a ground-source heat pump maintain comfort during the harsh winters, while operable clerestory windows flush hot air in summer. The roof is designed to hold snow for additional insulation, with heated gutters preventing ice dams. A sauna and cold plunge overlook a protected courtyard, offering a private winter refuge.",

      "fullDescription": "Rising through the branches of century-old Douglas firs, this residence required an entirely new approach to construction. Rather than clearing trees for a building site, the design team mapped the existing grove and threaded the structure between and around the massive trunks, sometimes allowing branches to pass through notches in the roof.\n\nThe main living level sits forty feet above the forest floor, accessible by a gently sloping elevated walkway that winds through the understory. From this vantage point, residents live among the birds and squirrels, watching fog roll through the canopy and storms approach from miles away. A spiral stair continues up to a rooftop observation deck that emerges above the tree line.\n\nStructurally, the house rests on a system of steel cables and compression posts designed to allow the trees to continue growing and swaying in the wind. The building moves slightly with its hosts—a sensation that takes some getting used to but eventually becomes deeply calming. Rainwater is collected from the roof and filtered through a living machine before use. Solar panels and a small wind turbine provide all necessary power.",

A dramatic lobby atrium rises through four floors, topped by a tensile fabric roof that filters the intense Southern California sun into a soft, diffuse glow. Suspended sculptures by local artists rotate slowly in the gentle updraft.\n\nGuest rooms feature floor-to-ceiling glass with operable balcony doors, allowing every room to benefit from the sea breezes. Suites on upper floors include private terraces with outdoor showers and hot tubs. The rooftop pool deck offers panoramic views of the bay, Coronado Island, and the distant mountains of Baja California. A full-service spa occupies a quiet wing at the building's base, with treatment rooms opening onto private garden courtyards.",

Rather than a single monolithic building, the program is distributed across a dozen structures of varying sizes connected by covered walkways, bridges, and shared gardens.\n\nEach building houses a different function—engineering, design, marketing, executive, dining—but no building is more than a three-minute walk from any other. The circulation system was deliberately designed to be inefficient by corporate standards: there are no direct routes, forcing employees to wind through gardens, past coffee bars, and across collaboration zones where they might encounter colleagues from other departments.\n\nThe campus is organized around a central quad inspired by traditional university greens, with a stage for all-hands meetings and outdoor movie screenings. Buildings step down in height from north to south to maximize solar access, and extensive green roofs reduce stormwater runoff while providing additional outdoor meeting spaces. The architecture is deliberately understated—simple volumes clad in warm wood and local stone—allowing the landscape to take precedence.",

Inside, the galleries are column-free spans of up to 200 feet, allowing curators complete flexibility in arranging exhibitions. Natural light enters through a sophisticated roof system that bounces daylight off adjustable louvers, providing the ideal viewing conditions for each artwork.\n\nTemporary exhibition spaces occupy a separate wing connected by a glass bridge overlooking a sculpture garden. Here, the galleries can be completely darkened for video installations or opened to direct sunlight for works that engage with natural light. A 500-seat auditorium, education center, and rooftop restaurant complete the program. The building's most dramatic moment comes at sunset, when the western facade transforms into a screen of reflected color.",

The architecture takes its cues from the ancient dwellings of the region's indigenous peoples, employing thick rammed-earth walls, small protected openings, and spaces that flow seamlessly between inside and outside.\n\nThe campus is organized along a spine that follows the natural contours of the site, minimizing disturbance to the fragile desert ecosystem. Treatment pavilions branch off this main path, each offering privacy and views to a different aspect of the landscape—the mountains to the north, the wash to the east, the sunset to the west. Between treatments, guests can wander meditation trails, soak in natural hot springs, or practice yoga in an open-air pavilion.\n\nAccommodations range from simple rooms to private casitas with their own plunge pools and outdoor living areas. The spa draws on both Western and Eastern healing traditions, offering everything from Swedish massage to Ayurvedic treatments to Native American sweat lodge ceremonies. Farm-to-table dining features produce grown in the center's own desert garden. No televisions, limited connectivity, and a strict no-phone policy in public areas complete the digital detox experience.",

The roof is supported by tree-like columns that branch as they rise, their form inspired by the cottonwood trees that once lined the nearby river. Clerestory glazing between roof panels floods the concourse with natural light while integrated photovoltaics generate a significant portion of the building's energy needs.\n\nBeyond its transportation functions, the hub serves as a civic gathering space and commercial center. Retail and dining line the main concourse, while a public plaza at the building's center hosts farmers markets, concerts, and community events. Underground, the building connects to the downtown pedestrian tunnel network, allowing commuters to reach their destinations without braving the winter weather.
